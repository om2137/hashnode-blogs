## Computer Science in Mumbai University R19 Scheme

# What will you learn in a Computer Science degree

## What is computer science	
Computer Science is a 4-year course as a branch of engineering. It covers all the domains in the field of computers and working behind it.
Computer science by definition is a study of the principles and uses of computers. During the 4 years, degree students study these domains in-depth. This 4-year course is divided into 8 semesters, 5 subjects per semester.<br>
We will see what are the domains/subjects/courses that we will learn in these 4 years. The structure of the course in this article follows Mumbai university R-19 scheme, but the subjects will be the same in most cases and may be changed in the order from university to university
