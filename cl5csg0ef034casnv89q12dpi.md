## Git  For beginners and 10 git commands

# Introduction
Git is an opensource version control system. It is a tool that is used to monitor changes in a git repository and allows various functionalities.
A Git repository is a tree-like structure where it has a head that point to the main/master branch of the repository, and other branches are created from the main/master branch, changes are made and committed, and then merged to the main/master branch.

### Few keywords to note

**Branches**<br/>
 In a version control system, there is a head that point to the main branch after that we can at any point create a new branch from the main branch to make new features and test them thoroughly. We can create as many branches as we want.

**Local** <br/>
Anything that is stored on your working machine offline. Eg a local repository is a repository stored on your computer.

**Remote**<br/>
Anything that is stored on cloud or remote location and needs internet access to interact with it. Eg a remote repository would be a repository stored on Github.

**Staging area**<br/>
when changes are made in the git tracked repository, they are added to the area to preview them before saving(track) them. This area is the Staging area.

**Commit**<br/>
When changes are staged and ready to be saved(tracked) we commit those which create the snapshot of the commit along a timeline to maintain the history of git repository.
